• **Core Value Proposition**: Transforms scattered enterprise knowledge into instant, conversational answers through natural language queries

• **Primary Capability**: Provides intelligent responses from Confluence and SharePoint repositories using MuleSoft's Anypoint Code Builder and AI integration

• **Target Users**: Enterprise knowledge workers seeking efficient access to organizational documentation and resources

 
## Inspiration and Problem Statement
• **Root Issue**: Despite significant investment in knowledge management platforms, information retrieval remained inefficient and time-consuming

• **Strategic Opportunity**: Leveraged MuleSoft integration capabilities with Model Context Protocol to create intelligent orchestration layer

• **Design Philosophy**: Enhanced existing knowledge systems rather than replacing them through natural language accessibility

 
## Technology Stack Components
• **Core Integration Platform**: MuleSoft serves as the central processing brain for KnowBot operations

• **Frontend Interface**: React-based user interface for query submission and result presentation

• **Development Environment**: Anypoint Code Builder for visual flow design and implementation

• **Knowledge Sources**: Confluence and SharePoint repositories for enterprise content retrieval

• **AI Processing Engine**: Mistral AI for natural language understanding and content analysis

• **Protocol Integration**: MCP implementation using Cursor for enhanced AI capabilities

 
## Anypoint Code Builder Implementation
• **Architecture Approach**: API-first design methodology with API-led connectivity principles

• **SharePoint Integration**: Dedicated connector for document library access and content retrieval

• **Confluence Integration**: HTTP Request component for external confluence rest api service

• **Performance Optimization**: Object Store implementation for caching frequently accessed content

• **AI Interface**: MCP Connector for seamless integration with artificial intelligence services

• **Entry Point Function**: MCP Tool Listener component configured with Server-Sent Events connectivity

• **Endpoint Configuration**: Accessible through /mcp-demo endpoint for structured tool requests

• **Processing Delegation**: Routes requests to appropriate sub-flows based on knowledge source requirements

• **Platform Coverage**: Handles both Confluence and SharePoint system queries through unified interface

• **Response Management**: Returns processed results to MCP clients in standardized response format

 
## Confluence Processing Workflow
• **Stage One - Query Analysis**: Natural language prompts forwarded to Mistral AI for intelligent keyword extraction

• **Search Construction**: Confluence Query Language URL construction using extracted keywords

• **API Integration**: Authenticated HTTP GET requests to Confluence REST API endpoint

• **Search Pattern**: CQL pattern implementation using title~'keyword' against india.atlassian.net instance

• **AI-Powered Filtering**: Original query and retrieved page titles submitted to Mistral AI for relevance analysis

• **Handling Large Result Sets**: Manages scenarios when Confluence searches exceed default page size limitations

• **Response Assembly**: Structured JSON format consolidation including page titles, cleaned content, and source attribution

 
## SharePoint Processing Workflow
• **Document Analysis Focus**: Implements intelligent document analysis and summarization for SharePoint document libraries

• **Keyword Extraction**: Mistral AI services process natural language queries to identify relevant business and technical terms

• **OData Query Construction**: SharePoint connector executes filtered queries against specified document library paths

• **Performance Optimization**: Efficient document content retrieval while maintaining system performance standards

• **Content Analysis**: AI examination of JSON and CSV file contents with comprehensive summary generation

• **Analysis Components**: Data structure analysis, content categorization, key field identification, and record counting

• **Output Format**: Structured analytical results in JSON format with file-level analysis and statistical information

 
## Project Impact and Measurable Outcomes
• **Time Efficiency**: Knowledge discovery time reduction from hours to minutes for enterprise users

• **System Unification**: Unified access provision to multiple enterprise systems through single interface

• **Contextual Intelligence**: Delivery of contextual answers with proper source attribution for information verification

• **Scalability**: System design capable of handling thousands of concurrent user requests

• **Performance Validation**: Successful demonstration of intelligent knowledge orchestration capabilities during hackathon

 
## Future Development Roadmap
• **Platform Expansion**: Integration extension to additional source systems including Jira and ServiceNow

• **AI Enhancement**: Implementation of advanced AI features incorporating user feedback learning capabilities

• **Mobile Development**: Mobile application development utilizing existing API foundation

• **Analytics Implementation**: Dashboard creation for tracking knowledge gaps and usage pattern analysis

• **Proactive Capabilities**: Development of knowledge sharing features that suggest relevant information proactively

• **Knowledge Graph Development**: Relationship mapping between different enterprise content pieces

• **Expert Identification**: System development connecting users with human experts when AI assistance proves insufficient

 
## Strategic Conclusion
• **Integration Philosophy**: Powerful AI applications emerge from intelligent layers connecting existing enterprise tools rather than standalone systems

• **Technology Combination**: Robust integration platforms combined with sophisticated data transformation and emerging AI protocols

• **Value Unlocking**: Organizations can unlock knowledge asset value without requiring extensive machine learning expertise

• **Future Vision**: Enterprise knowledge management evolution toward intelligent orchestration understanding context and usage patterns

• **Implementation Validation**: Hackathon experience demonstrated achievable capabilities using existing enterprise integration platforms with emerging AI technologies
